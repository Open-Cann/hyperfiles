/* Translating the ValueResolver.sol contract into Rust for a Substrate-based blockchain means creating a pallet that verifies if a specific amount of the native blockchain currency (similar to ETH in Ethereum) is attached with an attestation.
This requires a mechanism to check the transferred value against a target value set during the pallet's initialization.
set_target_value: This function sets the target value required for attestations.
on_attest: This function verifies if the value sent with an attestation matches the target value.
on_revoke: This function handles logic during revocation, if any specific actions are needed.
This implementation assumes the use of the native currency of the blockchain. In a real-world application, especially when handling funds, it's crucial to ensure that your code is secure and well-tested. Additionally, the actual mechanism of attaching value to a function call in Substrate may differ based on the design of your blockchain and the specific requirements of your application. Proper error handling and security considerations should be thoroughly addressed. */
